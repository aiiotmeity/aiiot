2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```
3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

   ```
5. Run migrations:

3. Start the React development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

## Prepare for Deployment

1. For the backend, configure settings for production in `settings.py`, including allowed hosts and database settings.
2. For the frontend, build the React app for production:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```
3. Serve the built React app using Django by configuring static files in `settings.py`.

## Deploy the Application

1. Choose a hosting service (e.g., Heroku, AWS, DigitalOcean).
2. Follow the hosting service's instructions for deploying a Django application and serving static files.
